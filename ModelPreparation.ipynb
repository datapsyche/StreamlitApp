    "The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content\n",
    "The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.\n",

The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages. The Grumbletext Web site is: [Web Link].\n",

The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The NUS SMS Corpus is avalaible at: [Web Link].\n",
    "-> A list of 450 SMS ham messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis available at [Web Link].\n",
    "-> Finally, we have incorporated the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big. It has 1,002 SMS ham messages and 322 spam messages and it is public available at: [Web Link]. This corpus has been used in the following academic researches:\n",
